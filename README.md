# collectionbuilder-sample-data

This repository contains three sets of data that are fully compatible with CollectionBuilder-CONTENTdm. To implement one of these as a collection, upload a corresponding csv and theme.yml file to the `_data` directory in your CollectionBuilder-CONTENTdm repository, then upload the collection's _config.yml file to the base of the directory.
