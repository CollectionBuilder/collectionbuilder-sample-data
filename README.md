# collectionbuilder-sample-data

This repository contains demo metadata for various CollectionBuilder templates. 

## Hosted Demo Collections

These metadata spreadsheets contain items with URLs to files hosted at University of Idaho Library--this means you do not need any objects in your project repository!
This makes it easy to use these examples to start up a sample project or experiment.
